These files defint the various elements of the digital twin process for the Oracle IoT cloud service
They are written in the Digital Twin Definition Language v3 (DTDLv3)- see the specification at https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v3/DTDL.Specification.v3.md
Identifiers are based on the Digital Twin Modeling Identifier (DTMI) - see https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/tree/master/DTMI
Items that do not use a full DTMI identifier are the elements defined in standard schemas at https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v3/DTDL.Specification.v3.md#standard-schemas
Note that the context may use extentions, see the list of extensions at https://github.com/Azure/opendigitaltwins-dtdl/blob/master/DTDL/v3/DTDL.v3.md#language-extensions

the reference data for the configuration is
{"softwareVersion":"1.18.4","timeOfUseSchedule":"[{\"start\":\"23:30\",\"stop\":\"00:00\",\"threshold_p_max\":22500},{\"start\":\"00:00\",\"stop\":\"05:30\",\"threshold_p_max\":20000}]","timestamp":"2025-11-18T16:47:32.900336Z[Europe/London]"}

the reference data for the status is
{"consumptionAvgWattsLastMinute":339,"consumptionWattsPointInTime":333,"currentBatteryCapacityPercentage":59,"currentBatteryCapacitySystemPercentage":62,"gridConsumptionWattsPointInTime":41,"operatingMode":2,"remainingBatteryCapacityWattHours":9102,"reservedBatteryCapacityPercentage":5,"solarProductionWattsPointInTime":131,"time":1763981430279,"timestamp":"2025-11-24T10:50:30.279369Z[Europe/London]","batteryCharging":false,"batteryDischarging":true}

Note that these will be updated over time. to get this data use a loval mqtt server and set the property mqtt.monitorreference.enabled to true (if missing it defaults to false.
Then as the status and configuration are published they wil be displayed as the contents string
